.. The Turing Machine is a hypothetical device invented by Alan Turing for his
   PHD Thesis. It was created with the intention of proving that a machine 
   could solve any complex mathematical problem given sufficient resources and 
   time. It has since become the cornerstone of programming, computer design,
   and computer science as a whole.

.. The Turing Machine is the logical cornerstone upon which every computer you
   have ever used was constructed. The Turing Machine is essentually a box
   which reads symbols off of a piece of data-tape. It then processes that
   information according to a table of rules not shown in this image. For
   examle the tape may read "1 + 1 ="; the table of rules might tell the
   computer ", if you see a plus symbol, apply it's operation on the numbers
   before and after it, and if you see an equal symbol print out the current 
   answer. This means that 1 + 1 = would be processed and result in the output
   of 2. The rules could also be changed to say if you see a mathematical
   operator apply it's operation to the following two numbers, so our input
   would have to change from 1 + 1 = to + 1 1 =.

.. The Turing Machine, originally called the A-Machine for Automatic Machine,
   was invented by Alan Turing for his PHD thesis when he graduated from 
   University in 1936. He was always a brilliant individual but this thesis in
   particular got him notice of the British Government which brought him on to
   the Code Cracking team which utilized the ideas of the Turing Machine to
   crack the World War II Nazi Enigma code. For his help he was rewarded
   although because of the secrecy of his project he was unable to publicly
   recieve credit for his work.

.. Why does the Turing Machine matter? For most of our day to day lives
   knowledge of the Turing Machine is neither helpfull nor useful, however
   if you ever want to program or use a computer to it's full potential 
   investigating and learing about the Turing Machine will give you the 
   first steps to being able to think like a computer so you are able to
   utilize modern technology as effectively as possible.

Writing an Email
================
*How to Craft the Best Email You've Never Written*

**...Until Now!**

.. note::

    Introduce yourself, what you're about to talk about, and why you are about
    to talk about it. <30 seconds


Goal
----

To make email suck less by writing an email that sucks less.

**Pillars of a good email:**

1. Organization.
2. Ease of information.
3. Grabs attention of reader.

.. note::

    Having a purpose helps tie things in as I go through my slides.


Do not

    :scale: 75%

.. note::

    None
    Jump right into what you should not to. Momentum permitting ask people why.
    This is a wall of text. Fuck walls of text.


Also do not

    :scale: 75%

.. note::

    Organization.
    This email is too short. It may serve purpose but as it takes up space I
    feel like it's a waste of my time. If you really only have that much to
    say does it need to be said? Can you say it somewhere else (slack, irc,
    etc)


It's simple
-----------
Know your audience.

.. note::

    Protip, if you think about who you're talking to and put yourself into
    their shoes things get a lot easier. This step is often overlooked when
    producing any media, including emails!


Better

.. note::

    Organzation.
    This message isn't too long, it's not too short. It clearly has something
    to say and I don't feel like it's a waste of my time.


Even better
-----------

    :scale: 75%

.. note::

    Organzation, ease of information.
    This email has a clear structre, it preambles what it's about to tell me,
    then goes into detail, and reminds me what it just said with a conclusion.
    Most importantly it's easy to process.


Bullet Points!

.. note::

    Attention.
    This is mostly used to grab attention. You may not want to include this in
    an email about budget cuts but it's perfect for an un to semi-professional
    email aobut an upcomming event.
